        <p>
          The modern web has a bloat problem. Megabytes of JavaScript, dozens of
          third-party trackers, and render-blocking fonts have made the average
          webpage significantly heavier than it needs to be. Users feel it every
          time a page takes more than three seconds to load – and most of them
          simply leave.
        </p>

        <h2>Speed Is a Feature</h2>
        <p>
          A plain HTML page served over a CDN can load in under 200 milliseconds.
          No framework warm-up, no client-side hydration, no layout shift while
          web fonts swap in. Visitors get instant content, and search engines
          reward the performance score with better rankings.
        </p>

        <h2>Less to Break</h2>
        <p>
          Every dependency you add is a potential security vulnerability, a future
          breaking change, and extra cognitive overhead for the next developer.
          Static sites with minimal dependencies age gracefully and require almost
          no maintenance.
        </p>

        <h2>The Takeaway</h2>
        <p>
          Before reaching for a framework, ask yourself: can I solve this with
          HTML and a little CSS? More often than not, the answer is yes – and your
          users will thank you for it.
